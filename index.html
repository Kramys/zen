Zen the Tech
  
Zen the tech, so calm, so bright,
His jacket’s on from morn till night.
He rides his bike with quiet flair,
And fixes IT bugs with gentle care.
  
He’s got a Staffy by his side,
A Monster Mango for the ride.
No Windows crash can steal his breath,
He laughs at the Blue Screen of Death.
  
At the end of a Youngtown day,
He powers down in his own way.
Rice for dinner, no champagne,
Tomorrow he’ll debug again.
  
Samsung Galaxy Tab in hand,
Technology at his command.
It hits the floor, he doesn’t frown,
Of course, he’s stuck a screen protector down!
  
Coke and Biscoff sweetened his day,
Oculus worlds not far away.
“Alexa,” he says, “play something tight.”
She blasts out static, “Close enough, right?”
